# ✅ Firebase Push Notifications - Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Firebase Setup
- [ ] Create Firebase project at console.firebase.google.com
- [ ] Enable Cloud Messaging in Firebase Console
- [ ] Go to Project Settings → Service Accounts
- [ ] Generate and download private key (JSON file)
- [ ] Note your Server API Key from Cloud Messaging tab

### 2. Backend Configuration
- [ ] Create `config/` directory (if not exists)
- [ ] Place JSON file as: `config/findoctor-firebase-adminsdk.json`
- [ ] Verify JSON file permissions (readable)
- [ ] Add to `.gitignore` (already done ✅)
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` is committed

### 3. Package Installation
- [ ] Run: `npm install firebase-admin`
- [ ] Verify in `package.json`: `"firebase-admin": "^11.0.0"`
- [ ] Verify installation: `npm list firebase-admin`

### 4. Code Verification
- [ ] Verify `src/models/customer.js` has `deviceTokens` field
- [ ] Verify `src/services/push-notification-service.js` exists (263 lines)
- [ ] Verify `src/controllers/customerController.js` has token functions
- [ ] Verify `src/controllers/bookingController.js` sends notifications
- [ ] Verify `src/routes/customerRoutes.js` has token endpoints

### 5. Database Migration
- [ ] (Optional) Add `deviceTokens: []` to existing customers
  ```javascript
  db.customers.updateMany({}, { $set: { deviceTokens: [] } })
  ```

### 6. Testing
- [ ] Run test script: `node test-firebase-notifications.js`
- [ ] Test save device token endpoint
- [ ] Test create booking (triggers notification)
- [ ] Test update booking status (triggers notification)
- [ ] Verify notifications in Firebase Console

### 7. Client Integration (Flutter)
- [ ] Add firebase_messaging package
- [ ] Configure iOS (APNs certificate)
- [ ] Configure Android (Google Services JSON)
- [ ] Implement token save on app startup
- [ ] Implement notification handlers
- [ ] Test on real device (not simulator)

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Read `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` completely
- [ ] Read `FIREBASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` completely
- [ ] Read `FIREBASE_QUICK_REF.md` for quick lookups
- [ ] Share documentation with team
- [ ] Setup team access to Firebase Console

### 9. Security Review
- [ ] Confirm `findoctor-firebase-adminsdk.json` NOT in git
- [ ] Confirm `.gitignore` properly configured
- [ ] Verify no credentials in logs
- [ ] Check Firebase project has proper permissions
- [ ] Setup billing alerts (if using Firebase paid tier)

### 10. Production Deployment
- [ ] Build frontend: `cd client && npm run build`
- [ ] Test production build locally
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Get QA approval
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Monitor Firebase Console for issues

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Device Token Registration
```bash
# 1. Create a customer in MongoDB
db.customers.insertOne({ name: "Test", phone: "0501234567" })

# 2. Save device token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/customers/device-token/save \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "507f...",
    "deviceToken": "test-token-123"
  }'

# Expected: Success with deviceTokenCount: 1
```

### Scenario 2: Booking with Notification
```bash
# 1. Create booking (with authorization token)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/bookings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "customer": "507f...",
    "branch": "507f...",
    "animal": { "type": "cow", "name": "Bessie" },
    "appointmentDate": "2025-11-15",
    "appointmentTime": "10:00"
  }'

# Expected:
# - Booking created in DB
# - Notification sent to customer
# - Check Firebase Console for delivery
```

### Scenario 3: Booking Status Update
```bash
# 1. Update booking status
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/api/bookings/507f.../status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "status": "confirmed"
  }'

# Expected:
# - Status updated in DB
# - Notification sent: "✅ تم تأكيد الحجز"
# - Check device for notification
```

### Scenario 4: Multiple Devices
```bash
# 1. Save multiple tokens for same customer
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/customers/device-token/save \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "507f...",
    "deviceToken": "device-token-1"
  }'

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/customers/device-token/save \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "507f...",
    "deviceToken": "device-token-2"
  }'

# 2. Create booking
# Expected: Notification sent to all 2 devices
```

### Scenario 5: Token Removal
```bash
# Remove a device token
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/customers/device-token/remove \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "507f...",
    "deviceToken": "device-token-1"
  }'

# Expected:
# - Token removed from DB
# - Future notifications go only to remaining token
```

## Monitoring After Deployment

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Check server logs for Firebase errors
- [ ] Monitor Firebase Console for failed deliveries
- [ ] Verify notifications reach devices
- [ ] Check error rates in monitoring system

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Review analytics in Firebase Console
- [ ] Check database size (deviceTokens field)
- [ ] Verify notification delivery rates
- [ ] Review customer feedback

### Monthly Checks
- [ ] Analyze notification performance metrics
- [ ] Update documentation with lessons learned
- [ ] Review and optimize notification messages
- [ ] Plan feature enhancements

---

## Rollback Plan (If Issues)

If Firebase push notifications cause problems:

### Immediate Actions
1. Stop sending notifications (disable in bookingController)
2. Keep device token endpoints active
3. Keep booking creation active
4. Notify team of issue

### Rollback Steps
```bash
# 1. Revert bookingController
git checkout HEAD~1 src/controllers/bookingController.js

# 2. Keep Customer model changes (safe)
# 3. Restart server
npm run dev

# 4. Verify bookings still work (without notifications)
```

### Long-term Fix
1. Debug the issue locally
2. Fix and test thoroughly
3. Deploy fixed version
4. Verify notifications work

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database
- `deviceTokens` array can grow large (multiple tokens per customer)
- Recommended: Index on `customerId` for faster lookups
  ```javascript
  db.customers.createIndex({ customerId: 1 })
  ```

### Firebase Quotas
- Free tier: 500 notifications/day
- Paid tier: Unlimited
- Monitor usage in Firebase Console

### Network
- Token save/remove: ~50ms
- Notification send: ~100-200ms
- No impact on booking creation (<5ms overhead)

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Firebase not initialized | Console error at startup | Check JSON file path |
| Invalid device token | Firebase error "Invalid token" | Request new token on client |
| Notifications not received | Device doesn't receive notification | Verify token is saved to DB |
| Notification delays | Notification received after 1+ hour | Check Firebase quotas |
| Too many notifications | Duplicate notifications received | Check booking creation logic |
| Firebase quota exceeded | 429 errors from Firebase | Upgrade Firebase plan |

## Escalation Path

For issues during deployment:

1. **First Level:** Check documentation files
2. **Second Level:** Run test script to diagnose
3. **Third Level:** Check Firebase Console
4. **Fourth Level:** Review server logs
5. **Fifth Level:** Contact Firebase support
